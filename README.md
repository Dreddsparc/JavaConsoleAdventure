Just a random idea I had on the way home today.  I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I thought I'd throw it 
out there and see what people think.  I was trying to think of a way to practice java objects and all the complexities
that go along with it.  Then I remembered those old text adventure games I used to play on trs-80's and apple ]['s.  
And there I had my project idea.  

Just a simple little game that will allow you to create a character and then go on an adventure.  The game will be a 
series of rooms that you can move between.  Each room will have a description and a list of items that you can pick up
or interact with in some way.  You may need  some items to progress into other rooms, or to disarm traps maybe?  Trap 
rooms may be present that will require you to disarm a trap to get through, or perhaps solving a puzzle or trivia
question will allow you to progress.  I'm not sure yet.  I'm just throwing ideas out there.   

to be continued...
